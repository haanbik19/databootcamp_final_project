Description: In this project, we examined the Airbnb listings in New York City, Sydney, and Paris. We compared the the types of listings and their prices across the cities as well as with local hotel listing prices. Additionally, we looked at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on these cities in relation to each city's lockdown policy.
